    introduction:
      "Hello! I'm Anna, a travel consultant living and working in London, UK üá¨üáß. Every month or two, I embark on new European adventures, discovering hidden gems and authentic cultural experiences.",
    description:
      "My passion for travel was sparked by my first major trip to South Korea, where I was amazed by how modern and different it was from Vietnam. That experience opened my eyes to the incredible diversity of cultures and experiences waiting to be discovered around the world.",
    journey:
      "What led me to travel consulting wasn't a coincidence‚Äîit was a deliberate choice. When I joined travel groups and communities, I saw so many people with the same passion for travel as me, but they had countless questions. Often, when they asked in groups, they'd get brief answers, or the knowledgeable members wouldn't respond at all. I saw myself in those travelers‚ÄîI remembered how difficult it was to find scattered information and piece together travel plans.",
    inspiration:
      "An inspiring woman in her 30s encouraged me to start writing and sharing my experiences. I began with visa application guides from the UK, and the response was incredible! My posts reached so many people, and I received countless messages with questions. I realized I could help others avoid the struggles I went through.",
    mission:
      "I believe travel is about freedom, curiosity, and discovery. My mission is to help others experience that same sense of wonder and liberation I feel when exploring new places. I love sharing what I know to help those who don't know‚Äîit's that simple. This work brings me joy because I'm naturally someone who enjoys helping others through knowledge sharing.",
    gratitude:
      "Thank you for following along on my adventures ‚ù§Ô∏è. I'm grateful for the opportunity to connect, share, and inspire others to explore with curiosity and freedom. If you have any questions about European travel or destinations you'd like to explore, don't hesitate to reach out!",
    wishes: "Here's to a year filled with amazing adventures, cultural discoveries, and unforgettable journeys!",
